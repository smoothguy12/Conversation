TODO
====

Short-term :
============
- Find a way to avoid code duplication between UI::Label and UI::Widget
- Managers (Music, Speech, Texture, Text)
- Controllers

Long-term :
===========
- Use the JSON Parser from Qt 5.0 instead of JsonCpp
- Fancy effects on texts

Unsure :
========

- Current Observer implementation is not corresponding to the Observer pattern since the
Observable entity should notify its Observers on each new event detection and have a public
method for Observers to get this particular event. Nevertheless, I'm not sure it would be
either worth the time or adequate.
- Should I use sf::Strings everywhere instead of std::string for proper Unicode support ?
