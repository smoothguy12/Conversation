TODO
====

Short-term :
============
- Factory
- Entities
- Handle rendering IRenderable objects in Window
- Managers (Music, Speech, Texture, Text)
- Mixer (Sounds)
- Controllers

Long-term :
===========
- Use the JSON Parser from Qt 5.0 instead of JsonCpp
- (UNSURE) Write specialized classes for Json reading (which would avoid Json::Value
dependencies in Managers) such as ListReader, HashMapReader...
- Fancy effects on texts
- Integrate a GUI library, or design a new one
